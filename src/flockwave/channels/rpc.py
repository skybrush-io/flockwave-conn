    """Proxy object that allows us to call methods on the remote side of an
    RPC connection or send notifications, using the familiar Python function
    call syntax.

    The proxy responds to the retrieval of one of its attributes by returning
    a function that can be called with arbitrary positional and keyword
    arguments. The name of the attribute, the positional and the keyword
    arguments are then converted into a single RPC request or notification
    object that is then dispatched to the remote side.

    At construction time, the proxy requires a function that takes the name
    of a method and a set of positional and keyword arguments, and that
    returns an awaitable that resolves to the response of the server (or to
    `None` if the request is a notification). The function must treat the
    `one_way` keyword argument in a special way; it must be used to determine
    whether the request needs a response (`False`) or not (`True`).
