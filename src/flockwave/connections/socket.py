                socket will bind to the IP address of the network interface if
                it has one. ``None`` means not to bind to a specific interface.
                Takes precedence over `host` and `subnet`.

                well as sending them, the host needs to be set to the empty

            broadcast_interface: the name or IP address of the network interface
                on which broadcast packets should be sent from this socket.
                Applies only if ``allow_broadcast`` is truthy. ``None`` means

            broadcast_port: the destination port to use when sending broadcasts.
                Automatically sets `allow_broadcast` to `True` when it is not

            multicast_interface: the name or IP address of the network interface
                on which multicast packets should be sent from this socket.
