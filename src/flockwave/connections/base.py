        - ``CONNECTED``: the connection is up

    may connect to if they want to be notified about changes in the connection
    states: ``state_changed``, ``connected`` and ``disconnected``.
    ``state_changed`` is fired whenever the connection state changes.
    ``connected`` is fired when the connection enters the ``CONNECTED`` state
    from any other state. ``disconnected`` is fired when the connection enters
    the ``DISCONNECTED`` state from any other state.

    Classes derived from this base class *MUST NOT* set the ``_state`` variable
    directly; they *MUST* use the ``_set_state`` method instead to ensure that
    the signals are dispatched appropriately.
