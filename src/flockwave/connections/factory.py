    def create(self, specification):
        """Creates a connection object from its specification. The
        specification may be written in one of two forms: a single URL-style
        string or a dictionary with prescribed keys and values.

        When the specification is a string, it must follow the following
        URL-like format::

            scheme:[//host:port]/path?param1=value1&param2=value2&...

        where ``scheme`` defines the registered name of the connection class
        (e.g., ``serial`` for serial ports, ``file`` for files and so on),
        ``path`` defines the target of the connection (e.g., the serial
        port itself or the name of the file), ``host`` and ``port`` define
        the hostname and the port where the path is found (if it makes sense
        for the given type of connetion) and the remaining parameters
        and values define additional connection arguments. The ``scheme``
        will be used to look up the connection class (or callable) registered
        in this factory, then it will be called with ``host``, ``port``,
        ``path`` and the additional parameters as keyword arguments. For
        instance, assuming that the ``serial`` scheme resolves to the
        SerialConnection_ class, the following URL::

            serial:/dev/ttyUSB0?baud=115200

        is resolved to the following call::

            SerialConnection(path="/dev/ttyUSB0", baud=115200)

        Parameter value that contain digits and positive/negative signs
        only will be cast to an integer before passing them to the
        connection class. Note that fractional numbers will *not* be cast
        to floats (to avoid any precision loss or rounding errors) - it is
        up to the connection class to handle floats appropriately.

        The other possible specification is in the format of a dictionary
        like the one below::

            {
                "type": "serial",
                "path": "/dev/ttyUSB0",
                "parameters": {
                    "param1": "value1",
                    "param2": "value2"
                }
            }

        When this specification is used, the ``type`` member of the
        dictionary will be used to look up the connection class (or
        callable) in the factory, the ``host``, ``port`` and ``path``
        members will be merged with the ``parameters`` dictionary (if any)
        and the merged dictionary will be passed as keyword arguments.
        ``host``, ``port``, ``path`` and ``parameters`` are all optional.
        No automatic type conversion is performed on the members of the
        ``parameters`` dict.

        Parameters:
            specification (str or dict): the specification of the connection
                to create, in one of the two possible formats outlined above

        Returns:
            Connection: the connection that was created by the factory
