        - ``PREPARING``: the listener is being prepared to accept connections

        - ``OPEN``: the listener is open and is actively listening for

    Each listener object provides three signals that interested parties
    may connect to if they want to be notified about changes in the listener
    states: ``state_changed``, ``open`` and ``closed``.
    ``state_changed`` is fired whenever the listener state changes.
    ``open`` is fired when the listener enters the ``OPEN`` state
    from any other state. ``closed`` is fired when the connection enters
    the ``CLOSED`` state from any other state.

    Classes derived from this base class *MUST NOT* set the ``_state`` variable
    directly; they *MUST* use the ``_set_state`` method instead to ensure that
    the signals are dispatched appropriately.
